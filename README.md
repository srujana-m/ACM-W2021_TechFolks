The problem statement we chose is Health issues are increasing day by day and so is the interest of people towards a healthy lifestyle with fitness, the diet is also an important part of a healthy life. 
To complete the daily requirement of nutrition, make a system that can analyze the diet of a user and dispense a multivitamin pill to complete the requirement.
In our website, we perform a simple questionnaire over a period of time in order to continuously monitor the daily food intakes of the user. 
Based on the result, the website analyzes the particular vitamin(s) deficiency and suggests the user with some of the common foods rich in that certain vitamin(s).
